<h1 id="multispi">multiSPI</h1>
<p>Scripts that talk SPI to APA102 LEDs using the multiplexing technology on the BetaBoard hardware.</p>
<p>These are currently written in Python, however the final project will have the SPI multiplexing handled by hardware and this software will only be used for image proccessing and serial output to the BetaBoard.</p>
<p>These are tested and working on a Raspberry Pi 2 running Ubuntu Server.</p>
